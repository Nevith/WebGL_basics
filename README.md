# WebGL_basics
Simple object rendering and lighting in WebGL<br>
Made to learn the basics of WebGL and consequently OpenGL

This application can open .obj files and show them in 3d space using webGL.<br>
It can use an orthographic or a normal perspective.

Objects do not cast shadows. Only normals are used for lighting.<br>
We use a [Blinn-Phong shading model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinn%E2%80%93Phong_shading_model)
<br>
[Bump mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bump_mapping) is also implemented.

Made for an assignment for `computer graphics` class at [FERI](https://feri.um.si/)
